. What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Creating an appealing user interface with CSS gradients and custom colors
- Implementing calculator logic with proper state management
- Handling edge cases (division by zero, decimal calculations)
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Grid and Flexbox layouts for responsive design
- Event-driven programming
- Creating smooth user interactions with CSS active states
- Designing for visual appeal while maintaining functionality

. Future Improvements

-  Add keyboard support for faster input
-  Implement backspace/delete functionality
-  Add calculation history display
-  Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
-  Add sound effects for button clicks
-  Include parentheses for complex expressions
 

. Design Philosophy

The pink color scheme was chosen to create a friendly, approachable and visually distinct calculator that stands out from traditional calculator designs. The gradient background and rounded corners give it a modern, soft appearance while maintaining professional functionality.
